# OBSOLETE â€” Upstreaming into Ansible itself

This repository is **no longer maintained**.
Instead, most of this functionality was upsteamed into <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>.
If you want to contribute, please send PRs to Ansible itself (and we'll help review).

See https://github.com/dkorn/manageiq-ansible-module/issues/85 for transition information.
You're still welcome to ask questions there or via new issues on this repository.
You can also ask on http://talk.manageiq.org/ and https://gitter.im/ManageIQ/api.
